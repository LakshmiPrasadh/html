<p>The Padmanabhaswamy temple is a Hindu temple located in Thiruvananthapuram, the state capital of Kerala, India.<br>The name of the city of Thiruvananthapuram in 
Malayalam translates to "The City of Lord Ananta", (City of the Divine Serpent)<br>referring to the deity of the Padmanabhaswamy temple. 
<br>The temple is built in an intricate fusion of the Chera style and the Dravidian style of architecture, featuring high walls, and a 16th-century gopura.
 <br>While the Ananthapura temple in Kumbla is considered the original seat of the deity ("Moolasthanam"), <br>architecturally to some extent,
 the temple is a replica of the Adikesava Perumal temple in Thiruvattar.</p>
